[Three points](https://github.com/csc2330-fall2019/three-points-hansonbriley)

Three points was an early class project. The program takes in three user input points, determines wether the points for a line or a triange. If the points form a line, the output will be slope and length. For a triangle, the program outputs area, perimeter, and the angles between them.
